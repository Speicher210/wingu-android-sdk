# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 3.5.0

### Added
- background iBeacon scanning can be configured to ignore Doze and App Standby 
    - `persistent` parameter of `WinguSDKBuilder#ibeaconBackgroundScan` method
    - changing the setting at runtime via `WinguSDK.Configurator#persistentIbeaconScanning`
- ability to change colors, font and button shape for content via `WinguSDKBuilder#deckStyle`
- pre-defined set of channel filters (subclasses of `de.wingu.sdk.channel.filter.ChannelFilter`) that can be used 
    when subscribing to `NearbyChannelObserver#getChannelEvents`, e.g. to receive events only with channels which were not displayed:
```
    nearbyChannelObserver.getChannelEvents().filter(UnseenContentOnly()).subscribe(...) 
```
- ability to apply channel filters before displaying notifications via `ChannelNotificationsConfig.Builder#addChannelFilter`

### Changed
- changed the way notifications work: by default all notifications are filtered only with `NewlyDiscoveredOrLost`,
    which means a notification for a channel will be displayed always when the device enters its range.
    To change that behavior, call `ChannelNotificationsConfig.Builder#addChannelFilter` with 
    `NewContentOnly`, `UnseenContentOnly` or your own implementation of `ChannelFilter`.

time after beacon is considered as lost.
